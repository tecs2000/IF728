# Activity Instructions

In this experiment, we should analyze the 2 LSBs of the P2 port and apply some changes in the P1 port based on them.

- If bit 0 equals to 1, P1's four LSBs = P0's four LSBs. Otherwise, P1's four LSBs = 0.

- If bit 1 equals to 1, P1's four MSBs = P0's four MSBs.
Otherwise, P1's four MSBs = 0.
